final keyword is used with a class, method and attribute

final keyword with class : 
  final class does not have children
  
final class ke bacche nhi hote

public class Test extends String{
}  // this is compilation error because final class can not be inherit
java.lang package is mostly final class 

for example for method:

public class A{

public final void test(){

}
}
class B extends A{
public void test(){
// override method
}

}

final method cannot be overridden 

for variable ::

public class A{

final int a = 9;

} 

if you use final keyword with attribute it will become a constant
